The problem I'm having with `reveal-init`
-----------------------------------------

I'm always frustrated every time I want to start a new Reveal.js project as a
Git repository.

Proposed solution
-----------------

I think you should add an option to initiate Reveal.js projects as Git repos
(e.g. `--git`).
